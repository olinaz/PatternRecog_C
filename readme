This project is written in C, targetting to recognzize shapes (rectangle, square or circle) from input image file in following steps:

	1) read the input image data from .pgm file and convert the image data into to-be-processed array
	2) find out the histogram of input array color value
	3) calculate the threshold of input array color level using Ostu algorithm
	4) convert the input array to binary array based on the threshold value
	5) do the 8-way connectivity ananlysis to find out how many objects in the image
	6) work on each object to figure out the shapes
